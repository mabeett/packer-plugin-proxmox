- `source` (string) - The file on the host to gather entropy from.
  `/dev/urandom` should be preferred over `/dev/random` as Proxmox PVE documentation suggests.
  `/dev/hwrng` can be used to pass through a hardware RNG.
  Can be one of `/dev/urandom`, `/dev/random`, `/dev/hwrng`.

- `max_bytes` (int) - Maximum bytes of entropy allowed to get injected into the guest every `period` milliseconds.
  Prefer a lower value when using '/dev/random' as source.
  `0` to disables limiting and according to PVE is potentially dangerous.
  Recommended value: `1024`.
